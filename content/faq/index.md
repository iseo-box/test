## What is Slab Jacking?  
Concrete leveling / Slab Jacking / Mud Jacking / Concrete Lifting is the process of pumping mud under the slab to bring it back up to original height.  No matter which term is used, it is all the same process.  

## What can be Slab Jacked?
All concrete can be Slab Jacked. Examples include driveways, steps, patios, pools, basement floors, garage floors, sidewalks, grain bins, city streets, boat ramps, parking lots, interior floors, loading docks, runways, highways, schools, generator pads, warehouse floors, and more. There may be a few circumstances when concrete cannot be Slab Jacked, and it’s best to get an estimate to find out. Also, if the concrete is severely broken up, it is usually better to have it replaced than Slab Jacked.  

## How much money will I save by Slab Jacking?
Slab jacking is approx 1/2 – 1/3 the cost of concrete replacement.  You can save up to 70% of removal and replacement.  

## How long does Slab Jacking take?
Average Slab Jacking  jobs usually take 1 – 4 hours. Larger jobs take longer, but usually are completed in only 1 day.  

## How long will it take to get my work done?
Once the bid is accepted, it may take 1-4 weeks depending on the current work load. However, if this is something that needs to be done ASAP, it can be scheduled in 1-2 days. Average mud jacking jobs usually take a couple of hours. Larger jobs take longer, but usually not more than 1 day.  

## How much room do you need to work?
It depends on the situation.  Our trucks stay out on the street and our pumper units fit through most gates.  If the project requires it, we can pump via slick line and reach interior areas or other hard to reach areas that our pumpers can not reach.  

## Why not replace?
Slab Jacking is just a less expensive alternative to your concrete issues.  It’s environmentally friendly and OUR MIX still allows your concrete to be recycled down the road.  

## How long will Slab Jacking last?
This process can last many years, even decades, because our product is crushed rock. It will not settle or deteriorate over time. However, if the ground is not 100% compacted or there continues to be soil washed out under the product, this may re-occur. If it does, these slabs can be lifted back into place again using the same holes.  

## How does Slab Jacking compare in cost to other repair or replacement options?
Mud jacking is approx – 1/3 the cost of concrete replacement and is environmentally friendly.  

## When can't you Slab Jack?
Retaining walls too close to the area can cause an issue and may not be able to be Slab Jacked. Areas where structural components are attached can cause issues as well. Every situation is different, and should be looked at by a professional to determine if this process will work for your situation.  

## Is there any maintenance needed?
Yes, caulking joints and drainage is a large factor.  All joints must be caulked after, in order to comply with our 2 year warranty.  

##How do rodents create problems?
Rodents, such as moles or groundhogs, will tunnel under concrete slabs or next to foundations. When water runs down through these holes, it can cause wash outs or ground settlement.  



## When can we drive on the driveway?
Vehicle traffic 4-6 hours after project completion for average size vehicles.  No Trucks for 24 hours.  

## Will my concrete crack?
Yes, all concrete can crack, especially lifting sunken slabs up into place. When the concrete sinks, it will get a stress crack on the bottom, but will not necessarily be visible. When the slab is then raised, the pressure will release and the crack will show on the top. These cracks are not caused by the Slab Jacking but are just made more apparent when raised. There can be cases where Slab Jacking will crack the concrete, if the correct process is not used.   

## Will my yard or sprinkler heads be damaged?
Sprinkler heads do not get damaged. Yards, if dry, have no damage what-so-ever. If sprinklers are left on or the ground is soft, some ruts may occur from the hydraulic pump.  Weak sprinklers line run directly in the concrete or directly under may burst from the movement.  Correctly installed lines are never in either location, so usually there are no adverse effects on your sprinkler system.  


## Can I expect to see any movement after the work is done?
Our mud mix does not shrink. The only time you would see movement is if the ground is not 100% compacted or you are getting water under our product washing out the soil and creating a void.  



## Does your work make a lot of noise?
No, our pumps and trucks sound like lawn mowers.  



## Does your work make a lot of dust or debris?
Drilling holes makes a little dust, and if we have to saw cut your concrete, this can sometimes make a lot of dust, if water is not used. Water can be used to keep dust down if this is an issue for the customer.  Please be sure to let us know if dust will create any issues for you.  


## Will the patched holes match my existing concrete?
No, not 100%. On new concrete, holes will match better because of concrete being lighter in color. Older concrete may not match as well because patched holes are lighter than the original concrete. However, over time, the concrete will darken with age and start to blend in better.  While every attempt is made, no guarantees on colors and/or matching can be made.  

## Why does Concrete Sink?
There are several reasons that can cause this problem.  The typical reasons for concrete settlement, when adjacent to a house or other structure, is improper back fill compaction.  Over time, this settles creating a void under the slab which results in concrete settlement.  



## Are there any problems associated with Slab Jacking?
If Slab Jacking is not done properly, too much force could cause cracking, blow outs, and over lifted concrete.  

## How does Slab Jacking work?
This process consists of drilling 1-5/8″ inch holes in the concrete slab, and pumping a mixture of limestone, portland and drilling mud underneath the slab to raise it to the desired height. Then, the 1-5/8″ inch holes are cleaned out and cement is placed in the holes.  

## How long has Slab Jacking been in existence?
Slab Jacking was started back in the early 1900’s, but then they pumped actual mud! There is where the term Slab Jacking originated.  

## What are the benefits of Slab Jacking over replacement?
This process usually takes a couple of hours compared to days. Vehicle traffic can drive on it in 4-6 hours versus 1-2 weeks. It is about 1/3 the cost of replacement. Landscaping and grass is not disturbed. You can walk on the concrete immediately where you cannot walk on concrete replacement for 1-2 days. This is important for commercial properties, including retail, hospitals, apartment complexes, or any heavily used walk areas.  

## What is a "Void"?
A void consists of a cavity under the concrete where dirt or rock has been washed away due to water or ground settlement. In return, the concrete is not supported properly and will cause sinking over time.  

## Can any concrete slab or block be raised or leveled?
Typically most concrete can be raised. However, there are many circumstances to consider. It is best to get an estimate to find out. Also, if the concrete is severely broken up, it is usually better to have it replaced than Slab Jacked.  

## Can Concrete Slabs be lowered?
No, not by the Slab Jacking process. However, the other slabs adjoining the higher slab could be raised up. Another alternative is concrete grinding to reduce a trip hazard.  We do have our own special patented piece of equipment that allow us, in some circumstances, to be able to lower concrete using water.  



## My front steps have sunken, and there is a gap at the top. Can they be raised?
This is a common problem with steps. Slab Jacking will usually fix stair and stoop problems more cost-effectively than replacement.  

## Tree roots have lifted my sidewalk. Can it be leveled?
It can be leveled but not lowered. For mild cases, the adjoining slabs can be lifted to match the height. Or the lifted slab can be ground on each end to reduce trip hazard. Otherwise, replacement is suggested.  

## Will the holes used in Slab Jacking be a different color than our existing cement?
On new concrete, holes will match better because concrete is lighter in color. Older concrete may not match as well because patched holes are lighter than the original concrete. However, the concrete will darken with age.  

## How and when is 'grinding' used?
Grinding can be used when slabs cannot be 100% leveled. Also if mud jacking cannot be used, grinding can take concrete down to reduce trip hazards. This is also a much cheaper process than replacement. Grinding is the process of shaving concrete down to the desired height.  

## How many holes will there be?
This depends on how large of an area and how much the concrete has sunk.  

## What makes your mixture (slurry) better than anyone else's?
All the Slab Jacking  companies usually use the same materials. However, certain situations will determine if different material is used, as well as different slurry mixtures.  Our mud mixture is crushed limestone with portland cement added as a hardener.  We will also use drilling mud depending on the site conditions to increase flow ability and friction while pumping.  


## How long does the concrete slurry take to dry and how do you fill the holes?
The time for the slurry to dry will depend on portland mixtures. Typically it will dry between 1 – 8 hours. It also depends on the quantity used. Holes are cleaned out and patched with cement.  

## What effect does it have on my existing landscaping?
Very minimal, if any.  Seattle Foundation Repair  Slab Jacking crew is in and out quickly, and all of our heavy equipment stays out on the street.  

## What is Mud Filling walls?
The mud jacking process is used to fill cinderblock walls or voids within structures.  

## What causes slabs to sink or become void?
There are several reasons that can cause this problem.  Seattle Foundation Repair and Slab Jacking can come out and evaluate your site and identify your site issues.  

## Does having something slabjacked mean there were structural problems?
Usually not, but in some cases, this could be the issue.  

## How can I prevent my slab from becoming void or sinking again?
Make sure the soil is 100% compacted (water soaking is the best compaction method). Also, make sure all ground is sloped away from home, and gutters and downspouts are working properly.  All concrete joints and cracks need to be sealed to keep water from working under the slab.  

## Are Slab jackers licensed?
Yes, Seattle Slab Jack is licensed and insured.  

## Is a Building Permit required?
Not in most areas that we service.
